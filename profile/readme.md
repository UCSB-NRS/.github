# About this GitHub Organization. 
*Note that this organization is currently under development. We are currently continuing to add resources and repositories as of 03/24/25.*

This GitHub organization was built to act as a centralized resource to improve visibility of research occurring at UCSB NRS sites. If interested in hosting your research here, reach out to get your repository added to the index or organizaton added to our list. 

## Click [HERE](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS/resources/blob/main/research-index.md) for Repositories Associated with UCSB NRS Sites  

The above is a link to an index of research and projects occurring at or around UCSB NRS sites. Reach out to get your work added!

For more on getting involved, see our [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS/resources/blob/main/quickstart.md).

## Purpose / Motivation  
At any given UCSB NRS site it can be difficult to know what research has been or is being done, what data is available, and who else is working there that could be a potential collaborator. The purpose of this organization is to provide a place for researchers to host their projects and get connected with others working at a given site. 

Also facilitates collaboration through the Discussions, allows direct collaboration by granting others access to your code and the assignment of issues, etc. 

### Who is this for?   

Graduate students, undergrads, research scientists, faculty members, and anyone who does work at the reserves! Our goal is to ensure that research happening at the reserves, and data being collected, doesn't get lost. This is not only for projects leading to publications, we're interested in any work asking and answering questions at the reserves. We're particularly interested in folks like graduate students, who may complete a project then move on.

## How it works   

The primary function of this organization is to aggregate research and other projects that are associated with the reserve. These links, organized by site then research group or grant and accompanied with short descriptions, are aggregated in our [Index of Research](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS/resources/blob/main/research-index.md). 

Alternatively, if researchers are interested in showcasing their work in the organization, we can fork their repositories. This add the repository the organization repository list, and we would also add the repository to the index. The fork would be set up to automatically stay up to date with the original, and we would make no changes. The idea of this is simply to further increase visibility

If you have a lab group that primarily conducts research at one or more UCSB NRS sites, we can also add a link to your organization to our list.
