# About this GitHub Organization. 

This GitHub organization was built to act as a centralized resource to improve visibility of research occurring at UCSB NRS sites. If interested in hosting your research here, reach out to get added to the team or get your affiliated organization added to the index. 

## Purpose / Motivation  
At any given UCSB NRS site it can be difficult to know what research has been or is being done, what data is available, and who else is working there that could be a potential collaborator. The purpose of this organization is to provide a place for researchers to host their projects and get connected with others working at a given site. 

Also facilitates collaboration through the Discussions, allows direct collaboration by granting others access to your code and the assignment of issues, etc. To learn more see [Advantages of Using GitHub](placeholderlink) . 

## How it works

Researchers that are interested in hosting their work here will be added to the organization, at which point they can either create a new repository to host their work or transfer a repository to the organization (at which point they will still maintain full ownership). 

Researchers will only have write access to their own repositories, unless granted access by another repository owner for collaboration. Additionally, if a researcher does not want their work publicly visible until publication they may set the repository to private until that time. 

If you want your repository displayed on you personal GitHub profile, you can:

1. Pin the repository to your profile
2. Fork the repository

If you’re already hosting your research on another GitHub organization (e.g. a lab group) we can either add a link to your work to our index, or we can fork your repository to the organization. 

## Contact / Getting Involved

# Structure

Repository names are prefixed by the site that they are associated with. The site prefix key can be found below in table 1. In order to find research projects at a particular site, using the “Find a repository” search bar and enter the prefix for that site. We request that all members of the organization follow the convention of prefixes their repository name by site. 

External repositories can be found in our [Research Index](placeholderlink) page.

|Site | Prefix |
|-----|--------|
|Santa Cruz Island   | sci |
|Carpinteria         | carp |
|Coal Oil Point      | cop |
|K.S.N Rancho Marino | rancho |
|Sedgwick            | sedg    |
|Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Lab | snarl |
|Valentine Camp      | val  |
__Table 1:__ Site prefix key. 

Additionally, repositories can be categorized using “topic” tags such as “botany”, “climate”, “hydrology”, etc. The set of tags is still under development as the organization evolves - reach out with any suggestions!
